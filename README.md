# React Task Manager and Api Call

## Description:

This project consists of two main components: a Task Manager and an API call component. Several technologies and tools have been used for its development, including React with Hooks (useState, useEffect), React Router for navigation, SASS for styles, and Bootstrap for the interface.

## Technologies Used:

- React: Used as the main framework for building the application.
- React Hooks:
- useState: For managing the state of components.
- useEffect: For performing side effects, such as API calls.
- React Router: For handling navigation between different views of the application.
- SASS: A CSS preprocessor that provides a more powerful syntax for complex and reusable styles.
- Bootstrap: Used for creating a modern and responsive user interface, including elements like buttons and cards.

## Task Manager Features:

- Task Creation: Allows users to create new tasks with a title, description, and deadline.
- Task Management: Users can edit, delete, and add additional notes to each task.
- Task Prioritization: Tasks can be prioritized in ascending and descending order using buttons.
- Task Status: Displays whether the task is "Due" or "Ontime" based on the current date.

## API Component Features:

- API Call: Utilizes the Axios library to make calls to an external API.
- Error Handling: Displays error messages in case the API call fails.
- Data Rendering: Renders the information retrieved from the API into cards, using the provided data.

This project demonstrates the ability to integrate various technologies and libraries to create a functional and modern application, spanning from task management to interaction with an external API.
